# Pixel Art Maker

## Why this project ?

This project was created as part of Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (Intermediate Javascript) about the topic: DOM manipulation.

It is a single-page web application that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

## How to run the app ?

Open the live app at https://alffox.github.io/pixel-art-maker/index.html

1) In the top part, set the size of the canvas
2) Choose a color
3) Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color. If you wish to get a "paintbrush effect", just keep the mouse button pressed and move the arrow in the canvas
4) If you wish to clear the canvas, just press the button "Clear the canvas"
