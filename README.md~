# pixel-art-maker

## Project for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree - Intermediate Javascript

Youâ€™ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

Your users should be able to:

* Dynamically set the size of the table.
* Choose a color.
* Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
